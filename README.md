## In a Nutshell

- **Paperfrogs/open** — tools and systems intended for broad use by developers, teams, and creators.  
- **Paperfrogs.dev** — commercial infrastructure for problems that need solving
- **Paperfrogs Labs** — research, prototypes, experiments. An incubator for ideas.
- **paperfrogs Mind** — experimental models, prompt libraries, and lightweight agents
- **Paperfrogs Inside** — side projects that don't fit anywhere else but deserve to exist

> Where infrastructure embeds, experiments ship, and research becomes real — Paperfrogs.

## Projects:

We are building long-term, infrastructure-first projects focused on real-world use, research-driven exploration, and production-ready systems. Our work spans embedded infrastructure, experimental research, and applied tooling—developed openly and iteratively over time.

- **[Fusion](https://playfusion.netlify.app/) - Audio Provenance & Verification Infrastructure**  (since 2023 - Present) - 
   A Rust-based audio engine for embedding cryptographically signed, inaudible watermarks at creation time, paired with a Python coded verification system for detection, validation, confidence scoring, and audit logging.
- TBA
